# Demo Video Guide (2–3 minutes)

Video link: `https://youtu.be/jNWdu4AaBdM`

## Target length

- **2–3 minutes** (screen recording + voiceover)
- **260–450 words** total voiceover (depends on your WPM)
- Recommendation: aim for **~360–420 words** so you can spend ~80% of the time on the demo visuals.

## What judges should notice (3 things)

1. **Accessibility**: bilingual (EN/FR), voice input (Whisper STT), and text-to-speech (TTS).
2. **Trust + transparency**: every non-greeting response shows **Official Sources** links (with “Updated” dates when available).
3. **Safe reliability**: if the assistant can’t confirm something from official sources, it says so and routes users to the correct official channel (311).

## Suggested time split (simple + realistic)

- **0:00–0:10** Hook
- **0:10–0:20** The problem (Kingston reality: fragmented info + 311 wait times)
- **0:20–1:40** Demo (this is the main grading leverage)
- **1:40–2:05** Key features to call out (sources, voice, report)
- **2:05–2:25** Ethics / privacy / inclusion
- **2:25–2:55** Feasibility + pilot timeline + scaling

## Pilot timeline (should we show it?)

**Yes — briefly.** A 5–10 second slide is enough. It directly helps the “Implementation Feasibility” rubric.

Example timeline slide:

- **Week 1–2**: expand the allowlisted official sources + confirm content coverage with City staff
- **Week 3–4**: add a staff “review queue” for reported answers + analytics dashboard (most asked / most reported)
- **Month 2**: integrate more municipal datasets (open data + service status feeds) and harden monitoring
- **By March**: limited pilot with a small set of departments + success metrics (call deflection, satisfaction)

## Voiceover script (≈390 words)

**Hook (10s)**  
“Imagine you have a simple Kingston question — garbage pickup, parking, or a bylaw — and the answer is buried across multiple pages, or you have to call 311 and wait. We built Kingston 311 Assistant to make that faster, clearer, and more accessible.”

**Problem (10s)**  
“Kingston residents often lose time navigating multiple websites and phone numbers. Staff face repetitive calls for questions that could be answered instantly — if we can keep answers trustworthy and tied to official sources.”

**What we built (20s)**  
“This is a City of Kingston 311 assistant with two modes: a RAG knowledge base for stable city policies, and an official-site lookup for time-sensitive updates like road closures, winter restrictions, and transit alerts.”

**Demo (≈80s)**  
“On the home page, residents can start a chat, see the latest information, and tap common questions.  
Let’s ask: ‘What are the property tax payment options?’  
The answer streams live, and underneath you’ll always see ‘Official Sources’ — direct links to the pages used, including ‘Updated’ timestamps when available.  
Now a time-sensitive question: ‘Are there road closures today?’  
For these, the assistant switches to official dynamic lookup, pulls the most relevant City pages, and answers only from those sources.  
For accessibility, residents can use voice input — we record, transcribe using Whisper, and submit the text — and they can also play the answer back with text-to-speech.”

**Judge-notice features (20s)**  
“If something looks wrong or outdated, users can click ‘Report’ on a response to generate a shareable report with the question, answer, and sources — supporting safe improvement and staff review.”

**Ethics / privacy / inclusion (20s)**  
“We don’t collect personal data. Answers are grounded in official, allowlisted sources, and the assistant clearly says when it can’t confirm something. The UI supports bilingual use and voice features to improve accessibility, aligned with AODA principles.”

**Feasibility + pilot timeline (25s)**  
“This is feasible with existing municipal web content and datasets. A pilot can start immediately: expand coverage with department owners, add a staff review dashboard for reported answers and high-frequency topics, then scale to more services and open-data feeds by March — reducing call volume, improving service quality, and helping residents access city information faster.”
